    <h1>When It Rains</h1>
   
    <p class="line">When it rains, my day is marred
        My plans, I’ll have to put on hold
        The rains come pouring through the windows
        When for once I forget to close them
        </p>

        <p>Oh No... a very big NO!
            The lights have also gone out
            How do I heat the water for my bath?
            Bathing is a must, you see
            So into the bathroom I must go
            </p>
            <p>Moments later, with chattering teeth and bursts of Brrrr
                I bury myself in my warmest clothes
                Then crawl and lay all snug under the covers.
                </p>

        <h1>The Legacy</h1>
    <p>
            When the wheels stop turning
And the bells refuse to ring
When the clock stops ticking
And the chimneys stop puffing smoke
At the end of the day, when all is said and done
And the bones lay rotten
        </p>
        <p>“What next?” is the question that comes to mind
            Abruptly ended good deeds rewarded by the faint, dying sounds of children’s laughter replays itself over and over like a long forgotten screenplay
            A gentle rebuke given to correct a naughty deed
            A silent nod to encourage good deeds
            A warm smile to congratulate a noble act
            </p>
            <p>A grateful sigh to appreciate a kind venture
                An emotional hug to welcome a lonesome wanderer
                Thunderous applause to appraise a wonderful show of excellence
                A royal command and a worthy example to establish bonds of love and teach how to forgive and let go
                Enough strokes of the cane to straighten a crooked future of mishap
                A promise to give an assurance of return
                A trusting hand to lead the way
                </p>
